# 🧬 Genetic Variation Analysis for Predicting Multiple Sclerosis

A Machine Learning-powered Streamlit web app that predicts the likelihood of Multiple Sclerosis (MS) from SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) genetic data. Upload your dataset, view risk insights, and download predictions with polygenic scores and odds ratios.

> Built by venkatesh P as a bioinformatics solution for genome-based MS risk evaluation.
> Utilizes Python, Streamlit, and scikit-learn libraries for efficient data analysis and visualization
> RUSA UNIVERSITY PROJECT -- UNIVERSITY OF MADRAS

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models Used

This project utilizes a hybrid ML architecture tailored for genomic prediction:

### 🧠 Main Model
- **XGBoost Classifier**
  - Handles non-linear relationships in genetic markers
  - Great for high-dimensional SNP data
  - Used for predicting Disease/Trait presence and severity

### 🌲 Backup Model
- **Random Forest Classifier**
  - Used as fallback for binary classification
  - Helps improve ensemble stability

### 📈 Outputs Generated
- **Predicted Disease/Trait** (e.g., Multiple Sclerosis)
- **Odds Ratio / BETA**: Risk influence of a SNP
- **Polygenic Risk Score (PRS)**: Cumulative genetic risk estimate
- **Risk Allele Frequency Visuals**

All models were trained using curated SNP datasets with key columns like `riskAllele`, `riskFrequency`, `orValue`, `traitName`, and `pValue`.
